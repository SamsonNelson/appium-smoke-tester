# Appium Smoke Tester

This is a WIP.

Use this project as a painless starting point for setting up the necessary environment
to start crafting your own smoke tests for [Appium](http://appium.io). For now, the prime concern is __hybrid mobile app tests__.

More example test cases will be added as time goes on. This will include interaction (swipe, scroll, etc...) testing helpers,
tips and anything else that can get us going quickly with our own testing.

__Contributions are very welcome__ - I want this to be a great resource as getting all the parts to work out of the box can be a pain.
